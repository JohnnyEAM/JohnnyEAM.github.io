                <summary><h3>Week 1</h3></summary>
                <p>The first week with Liz Sokolowski we covered the aims of the module as well as the content which
                    we will be covering alongside the software which we will be using to complete our tasks for
                    the module. We covered all the Assessments which we will be doing as well as the percentage of our
                    grade which they cover. We then began to cover the many different uses of a database as well as different database environments alongside the pros and cons of each environment. Finally we covered why this module
                    is great for us and were shown database related job opportunities with over 50 different job titles.

                <summary><h3>Week 2</h3></summary>
                <p>The second week with Liz Sokolowski we covered Entity Relationship, ER, Diagrams.
                    We covered what the Diagram is, and what it contains. We then went on to break down the three 
                    components of the ER diagram, Entities, Attributes and Relationships. Such as Derived/Composite 
                    attributes, and all the different types of relationships. Such as one to one, one to many, etc. 
                    We then covered how to create a database using an ER diagram, Entities become tables, attributes become 
                    columns, and relationships between the tables/entities. 
                    We also covered many errors/traps which can occur when creating an ER diagram, such as Chasm and Fan traps.

                <summary><h3>Week 3</h3></summary>
                <p>The third week with Liz Sokolowski we covered Normalization. We went back over functional 
                dependency and covered functional dependency diagrams. We then went over all the different Normal 
                form and what they are. 1NF, 2NF and 3NF. We then covered how to go from each stage of normal form, 
                to another. We also covered denormalization, and why it can help a system run faster. 
                We also went through, as a class over many 
                different normalization exercises to solidify our knowledge on the topic in 
                preparation for an upcoming test in week 6.

                <summary><h3>Week 4</h3></summary>
                <p>In this with Liz Sokolowski session we learned how to, Identify and draw recursive 
                    entity relationships, Identify and draw mutually exclusive relationships, Identify 
                    and draw super type and sub types , Identify and resolve fan and chasm traps. A fan trap 
                    is when a model represents a relationship between entity types but the pathway between certain 
                    entity occurrences is ambiguous, and a chasm trap occurs where an ER diagram suggests the existence of
                    a relationship between entity types but where a path might not exist between entity instances.

                <summary><h3>Week 5</h3></summary>
                <p>This week with Liz Sokolowski our Learning objectives were To identify the components of an SQL 
                    SELECT statement, Use an ORDER BY clause to order the output from a query, Use arithmetic 
                    functions in a query , Perform searches for NULL values and Use the DUAL table to test functions.
                    This week we also had a test in the seminar session to complete which determined 20% of our grade.

                <summary><h3>Week 6</h3></summary>
                <p>This week with Liz Sokolowski we covered Selected SQL string functions, 
                    Date functions and how to select data through the use of the WHERE clause. 
                    Ultimately the end goal was to be able to retrieve data using the SQL string function, 
                    SQL date and miscellaneous function and retrieve 
                    selected data using the WHERE condition. We learnt many different functions such as SUBSTR and INSTR.

                <summary><h3>Week 7</h3></summary>
                <p>This week with Liz Sokolowski, our objectives were : 
                    To understand how data can be grouped for aggregated queries , To use aggregate 
                    functions in retrieving data , To filter aggregated data using the HAVING clause. 
                    In the lecture I learnt what aggregate functions are, they are (multiple row functions) 
                    which return one result per group of rows processed and are Used to count/summarize data. 
                    We then covered what the syntax and purpose of each function are, such as AVG - gives average 
                    value of a numeric column , SUM - gives sum of numeric column , MAX - gives maximum 
                    value of a column , MIN - gives minimum value of a column , COUNT - counts the number of selected rows.

                <summary><h3>Week 8</h3></summary>
                <p>This week with Liz Sokolowski we covered transaction management and concurrency control. 
                    The main concepts of this week were Database transaction, ACID properties of transactions, 
                    and Locking and Optimistic measures of concurrency control. The learning outcomes of this week 
                    were to understand what a database transaction is and what its properties are. Analyses the problems 
                    of data management in a concurrent environment, and to compare the relative strengths of different 
                    currency control approaches. During this week we have been working on our group assignment to construct 
                    a fully functioning database system for a school planning external events.

                <summary><h3>Week 9</h3></summary>
                <p>This week with Liz Sokolowski we covered Data definition language, DDL. 
                    In this lecture we learnt how to create and delete tables, add constrains to a table, 
                    how to modify tables, how to insert, update and delete data/attributes from within a table. 
                    And finally the purpose of views and their creation. There are different levels of constraints
                    and different ways to insert them. Column level, table level and inserting. Column level is when 
                    the constraints definition is included as part of the column definition. Table level is when the
                    definition is separate 
                    from the column definition and defined after them. And Inserting is after the table has been created.

                    concurrency control. The main concepts of this week were Database transaction,
